    <string name="statuteText">We expect all advertisers to comply with the local laws for any area their ads target, in addition to the standard Google Ads policies. We generally err on the side of caution in applying this policy because we don’t want to allow content of questionable legality.

Below you will find country-specific legal requirements, but note that this is not an exhaustive list. Advertisers are expected to do their own research on the local regulations for any location their ads target. Learn about what happens if you violate our policies.

Please also note that certain countries, industries and trade associations have their own self-regulatory codes for advertising and marketing. You can find a list containing some of these codes here. Advertisers on Google should refer to these codes where relevant.

If we receive a valid legal request indicating that your ads infringe local law or applicable regulation or code of practice, we may disapprove them locally in the jurisdiction where they are illegal.

Legal requests to remove content can be submitted by any user or government entity to Google through the Legal Help Center at g.co/legal.

As part of our efforts to remain transparent, a copy of each legal request we receive may be sent to the Lumen project for publication. Advertisers can find information on complaints made against their ads on Lumen by searching the relevant Ads URL.

Advertisers may also reach out to Google Ads Support if they have other questions about legal removal requests. We encourage advertisers to first resolve this matter directly with the claimant who submitted the legal notice.
